The first time you run Airflow, it will create a file called airflow.cfg in your $AIRFLOW_HOME directory (~/airflow by default). 
This file contains Airflowâ€™s configuration and you can edit it to change any of the settings. You can find this file and search for web_server_port. Then change it to any unused port, e.g. 8081. This will change the port from 8080 to something like 8081.
You can then run airflow webserver as usual, http://localhost:8081/

python3 -m airflow webserver -D will start the webserver.
python3 -m airflow scheduler -D will start the scheduler.

python3 -m airflow users create --username mmuratarat --password Quake7446632 --firstname Murat --lastname Arat --role Admin --email arat.murat@gmail.com
will create database user foer Airflow

ps aux | grep airflow will show all airflow processes.

cat ~/airflow/airflow-scheduler.pid will return PID of Airflow Scheduler
cat ~/airflow/airflow-webserver.pid will return PID of Airflow Webserver

 Airflow creates files with process IDs of the scheduler and gunicorn server in its home directory (by default ~/airflow/). Running

kill $(cat ~/airflow/airflow-scheduler.pid)

Will terminate the scheduler.


Unfortunately, airflow-webserver.pid contains the PID of the gunicorn server and not the initial Airflow command that started it (which is the parent of the gunicorn process). So, we will first have to find the parent PID of the gunicorn process and then kill the parent process.

kill -9 $(ps -o ppid= -p $(cat ~/airflow/airflow-webserver.pid))
